        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

Typically, parameters of trained models are stored in a 32-bit format, but QLoRA compresses them to a 4-bit format. This reduces the memory footprint of the LLM, making it possible to finetune it on a single GPU.

It assigns weights to each element in the input sequence, highlighting the elements that are most relevant to the task at hand. This not only enhances the model‚Äôs understanding of the data but also improves its performance in tasks like language translation, image captioning, and more. [...] There are several types of attention mechanisms, including:\\n\\n   Self-Attention Mechanism: Used in tasks involving sequences like natural language processing.\\n   Scaled Dot-Product Attention: An efficient mechanism that‚Äôs a key component of the Transformer architecture.\\n   Multi-Head Attention: Allows models to focus on different parts of input data simultaneously.\\n   Location-Based Attention: Commonly used in image-related tasks, assigning attention based on spatial location. [...] Conclusion\\n==========\\n\\nIn the world of deep learning, attention mechanisms stand out as a powerful tool for enhancing model performance. Their ability to mimic human-like selective focus has transformed a wide range of applications, from machine translation to image captioning.

Instead of retraining the entire model, LoRA adds lightweight, low-rank matrices to the frozen original model. These matrices contain new weights that modify the model's outputs with minimal computational effort and training time. LoRA is particularly useful for fine-tuning large language models and vision transformers, making the process faster, more memory-efficient, and easier to share.

His research focuses on making foundation models like ChatGPT more accessible by reducing their resource requirements. He has developed systems and algorithms for memory-efficient, fast, and cost-effective deep learning, including the creation of the bitsandbytes library. He has received multiple awards for his work at conferences such as ICLR and NeurIPS. [More about him](https://csd.cmu.edu/people/faculty/tim-dettmers)\\n\\n3. **Attention in Machine Learning**: Attention mechanisms are methods that allow models to focus on specific parts of the input data, assigning different weights to different elements based on their importance. This concept, inspired by human cognition, helps models handle sequences more effectively by selectively concentrating on relevant information. Attention has been a paradigm shift in deep learning, underpinning architectures like Transformers, and is widely used in natural language processing, image captioning, and other tasks. It enables models to decompose complex problems into manageable reasoning steps and improves their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
